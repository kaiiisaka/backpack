                            My name is Alex, but you probably know me as snakefish.
                            I am a big fan of NFT art, a programmer and I am very
                            interested in everything related to the concept of web3.
                            I have been studying blockchain and cryptocurrencies
                            for a long time. I want to connect my life with it.
                            Even on my discord avatar, you see a picture that
                            was drawn by NTF artist Joiceeloo. Since I use both
                            Solana and Ether and many other networks, I really
                            want to use a backpack, I just canâ€™t imagine how
                            convenient a crypto wallet should be. <br/>
                            WAO!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <img
                    src={SF}

                <Stroka />
                <br/>
